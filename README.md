# Bookmarks Enhancer

This is a small side project I made for job hunting. It's not an official Firefox extension, so it can only be used in a developer version of Firefox at the moment.

It allows the user to block or highlight specific elements based on whether they're bookmarked in a folder named "Blocked" or "Favorited".

This was useful in my job search, as some sites don't do a good job of letting you know which jobs you've applied for, and which you've been rejected from already.

It's still not in a very user friendly state at the moment, which is why I haven't tried to get it released as an actual Firefox extension.

## Instructions

1. Bookmark the thing you want to block/highlight in the corresponding folder.

2. Visit the page, and inspect it to find the corresponding class you want to block.
